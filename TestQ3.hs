{- 
Solve the first three problems using map, filter or fold.
I solved them using point free style and composition.
-}

{-
beginA takes a list of words and returns a list of 
all those words that being with capital A. 
-}
beginA :: [String] -> [String]
beginA  = filter (\x -> head x == 'A' || head x == 'a')



{-
pigLatin takes a list of words and removes the first letter
from each of those words and adds "way" to the end.
-}
pigLatin :: [String] -> [String]
-- Fill in your code here
pigLatin xs  =  map (++"way") (map tail  xs)  

{-
longest takes a nonempty list of words and returns the longest
word in that list.  If there is more than one longest
word, it returns the first of them.
-}
longest :: [String] -> String
-- Fill in your code here
longest =  foldr (\l acc -> if length acc > length l then acc else l) []


{-
Examples:
*TestQ3> fruit = ["Apple","Banana","Apricot","Prune"]
*TestQ3> beginA fruit
["Apple","Apricot"]
*TestQ3> pigLatin fruit
["ppleway","ananaway","pricotway","runeway"]
*TestQ3> longest fruit
"Apricot"
-}


{-
modify takes
  1. an element x of type a
  2. an element y of type b
  3. a function f from a's to b's
it returns a function that is identical to f except it maps x to y
Example:
*TestQ3> notQuiteEven = modify 3 True even
*TestQ3> notQuiteEven 5
False
*TestQ3> notQuiteEven 4
True
*TestQ3> notQuiteEven 3
True
-}
modify :: Eq a => a -> b -> (a -> b) -> (a -> b)
-- Your code goes here
modify x y f = \z -> if z == x then y else f z


{-
encryptf takes
  1. a list xs of a's
  2. a list ys of a's
it returns a function that
  maps elements of xs to the corresponding element of ys
  and maps everything else to itself
Example:
*TestQ3> encrypt = encryptf "abc" "def"
*TestQ3> encrypt 'b'
'e'
*TestQ3> encrypt 'g'
'g'
-}
encryptf :: Eq a => [a] -> [a] -> (a -> a)
-- Your code goes here
encryptf (x:xs) (y:ys) = \z -> if z == x then y else (encryptf xs ys) z
encryptf [] [] = \x -> x


{-
exec' is the same as exec in the previous assignment
There is only one difference
  instead of representing memory by pairs (String,Int)
  it represents memory by a function from String to Int
Each variable is mapped to its value  
-}

type Inst = (String,String,Int)  
type Memf = String -> Int

exec' :: [Inst] -> [Inst] -> Memf -> Int  
--exec prog cur mem | trace ("exec " ++ show  (head cur) ++ "  " ++ show mem) False = undefined 
-- Your code goes here
exec' prog (("ret",var,_):_) mem = mem var
exec' prog (("add",var,num):x) mem = exec' prog x (modify var (mem var + num) mem )
exec' prog (("jmp",_,num):_) mem = exec' prog (drop num prog) mem
exec' prog (("blz",var,num):rest) mem 
 | mem var <= 0 = exec' prog (drop num prog) mem
 |otherwise = exec' prog rest mem
exec' prog (("load",var,num):rest) mem = exec' prog rest (modify var num mem) 
exec' _ [] mem = 0


{-
test_exec' calls exec' as in the previous assignment
The only difference is that all variables are should be set to zero
-}
test_exec' :: [Inst] -> Int
-- Your code goes here
test_exec' prog = exec' prog prog (\x ->0)

{-
Test case for test_exec'

Example:

test_exec' prog1
9

prog1 :: [Inst]
prog1 = [("load","x",4),("load","y",5),("load","z",0),
         ("blz","y",7),("add","z",1),("add","y",(-1)),("jmp","",3),
         ("blz","x",11),("add","z",1),("add","x",(-1)),("jmp","",7),("ret","z",0)]

search takes the following parameters
  1. A function to check if the search is done
    - this function takes:
      a. the global information for the problem
      b. the partial solution
    - the function returns a bool indicating if solution is complete
  2. A function to find the valid next states to go to
    - this function takes:
      a. the global information for the problem
      b. a partial solution
    - the funtion returns a list of valid next states
  3. Global information for the problem
  4. A partial solution
    - a partial solution is a list of states in reverse
search returns a list of all full solutions reachable from
  the partial solution
    - full solutions will be in forward order
-}
search :: (Show a, Show b) =>
  (a -> [b] -> Bool) -> (a -> [b] -> [b]) -> a -> [b] -> [[b]]

The following are used to test search for the maze problem
This is already written, there is nothing for you to do here

Global maze information includes:
  1. Size of the maze
  2. List of blocked cells
  3. End of the maze
